## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

SurakshaNet is designed with the following ethical guidelines:

1. **Privacy Protection**: The system processes data locally where possible and does not store sensitive information unnecessarily.

2. **Simulation Disclaimers**: Modules like NetraTrace and NigraniAI clearly indicate they are simulations and not operational surveillance systems.

3. **Human Oversight**: All AI-generated analyses are meant to assist human officers, not replace their judgment.

4. **Transparency**: The system provides explanations for its assessments and confidence scores.

5. **Limitations Awareness**: Users are informed about the limitations of AI analysis and the need for verification.

## Roadmap

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- Integration with real-time UPI transaction monitoring
- Enhanced deepfake detection capabilities
- Improved audio analysis for regional languages
- Mobile-responsive design for field operations

### Medium-term (6-12 months)

- Advanced analytics dashboard with trend analysis
- Multi-language support for all modules
- API endpoints for integration with existing police systems

### Long-term (1-2 years)
