## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

SurakshaNet is designed with the following ethical guidelines:

1. **Privacy Protection**: The system processes data locally where possible and does not store sensitive information unnecessarily.

2. **Simulation Disclaimers**: Modules like NetraTrace and NigraniAI clearly indicate they are simulations and not operational surveillance systems.

3. **Human Oversight**: All AI-generated analyses are meant to assist human officers, not replace their judgment.

4. **Transparency**: The system provides explanations for its assessments and confidence scores.

5. **Limitations Awareness**: Users are informed about the limitations of AI analysis and the need for verification.
